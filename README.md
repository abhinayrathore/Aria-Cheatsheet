# A self updating WAI-ARIA Cheatsheet for [10k Apart Challenge](https://a-k-apart.com)

As part of the [10k Apart Challenge](https://a-k-apart.com) I built this self updating WAI-ARIA Cheatsheet where the initial payload is less than 10kb. The page works even without JavaScript by rendering the cheatsheet on server side. For more rules, please refer: https://a-k-apart.com/faq.

### Demo: http://lab.abhinayrathore.com/aria-cheatsheet-10k/

## Features:
* Under 10kb of initial payload
* Follows web accessibility guidelines
* Mobile first responsive design
* Works with older browsers (IE9+)
* Uses progressive enhancement to add features
